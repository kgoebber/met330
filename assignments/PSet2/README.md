**Problem Set \#2**

**Assignment Learning Objectives**

1.  Write a program that uses selective and repetitive control to solve
    higher complexity programming problems and reads input from a file

2.  Apply the correct programming tools to efficiently solve problems

3.  Practice robust computer coding strategies

**Due 8 September 2020 by 3:00 pm**

*Due Online*

-   One script in the PSet2 repository on your GitHub account

*Due Via Blackboard*

-   A PDF version of your code. Make sure the honor code appears in the comment block at the beginning of the script and that it has your full typed out name. This will serve as your assertion that you have upheld the honor code.

**Honor Code**

You must type the full honor code into each comment block to indicate
that you have upheld the code. Authorized aid for this assignment is
your notes and any previous programs you have written. You are highly
encouraged to work with others in the class to help diagnose bugs and
work out programming logic. Any copying of someone else's code IS A
VIOLATION OF THE HONOR CODE, whether from a classmate, or the Internet.
*Be sure to indicate with whom you have worked in the comment block of
your submission.*

**Background**

Progress in science is based on the collecting and analyzing of data and
meteorology is a clear example of a data-driven science. With
meteorological data, *time* plays an inordinately large role in properly
describing the atmospheric conditions due to the large daily, weekly,
monthly, yearly, etc. variability. Most elements of time area consistent
and not terribly difficult to work with; however, with long period
meteorological records a notorious problem lurks within the data, *leap
day*. In the vast majority of years there are only 365 days, but Earth
actually travels around the sun in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 min, and 46
sec. In order to account for the extra time we add a day (leap day) in
some years, according to a set of rules, to make up for lost time.

*Leap Year Definition*

Add a leap day every four years when the year is divisible by 4, but not
if the year is divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

Due to the vastly fewer numbers of leap days (Feb 29) within
meteorological records, some datasets don't include it! Yet, it is an
actual day that must be accounted for in many circumstances.

Another aspect of time that needs special attention is the day of the
year. The common way to identify a day is by using both the month and
day (e.g., 6 June), but that is relatively complicated when really it is
just one day in a sequence of 365 (or 366 in a leap year). Therefore,
there are certain segments of the meteorological community (e.g.,
satellite meteorology) that use the *Julian Day* of the year. Note: This
is very different from Julian Date, which is the continuous number of
days since 1 January 4713 BC on the Julian calendar.

*Julian Day Definition*

> The day of the year as a single numeric value between 1 and 365 in
> non-leap years, starting on 1 January, increasing by 1 each day
> through 31 December.

**Problem**

1.  Write a program that will determine if a series of ten (10) daily
    high temperatures are normal (between the first and third quartile,
    inclusive), well above/below average (above \[below\] the third
    \[first\] quartile, but not record level), or record breaking for
    the meteorological season in which they occur.

    Program Name: **climate\_check.for**

    Program Input: From a file read a series of year, month, day, high
    temperature in Fahrenheit

    Program Output:

-   Date in Year, Month, Day format

-   Leap Year Indicator

-   Julian Day

-   Indication of "Normal Temperature", "Well Above Average
    Temperature", "Well Below Average Temperature", "Record Temperature"
    with the meteorological season that it occurred in.

| Season | Record High | 75% | 50% | 25% | Record Low |
| ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- |
| Winter | 71     | 41  | 34.2 | 28  | -10    |
| Spring | 96     | 71  | 58.6 | 47  | 13     |

| Fall   | 101    | 74  | 62.8 | 52  | 10     |

Notes:

-   Break the problem down into smaller bite size pieces. For example,
    first write your program to be able to determine if a year is a leap
    year from a command line input. Then submit that working code to
    your GitHub repository for this assignment. Now go back and read a
    series of years from a file, and so on.

-   Fortran has a number of built in functions, some of which might be
    useful in this case. Specifically a function called "MOD" and "SUM"
    might be of interest.

-   Make sure to regularly submit your work to your GitHub site. Part of
    your grade on each assignment is on your regular submission of the
    program(s) as they are in progress of being developed. This is
    easily done when regularly submitting the bite size pieces that you
    create when breaking down any coding project!

-   Test more than just the cases or example file given below. An
    important part of code development is testing to make sure your code
    works for ALL cases, so think about "edge" cases that you know to be
    problematic and test those specifically.

    *Please make your program to produce output in the same fashion as
    the test cases below.*

    **Test Case 1**

    \> Begin Record \<

    Year Month Day

    Date: 2000 2 18

    2000 is a leap year

    Julian Day of the year: 49

    Temperature (F): 72.000000

    Climate records indicate that this temperature is

    a record warm temperature for winter.

    \> End Record \<

    **Test Case 2**

    \> Begin Record \<

    Year Month Day

    Date: 1995 7 4

    1995 is a leap year

    Julian Day of the year: 185

    Temperature (F): 85.000000

    Climate records indicate that this temperature is

    within normal range for summer.

    \> End Record \<
