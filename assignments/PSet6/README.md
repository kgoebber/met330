**Due 27 October 2020 by 3:00 pm**

*Due Online*

-   The final script in the PSet6 repository on your GitHub account

*Due Via Blackboard*

-   A PDF version of your code. Make sure the honor code appears in the comment block at the beginning of the script and that it has your full typed out name. This will serve as your assertion that you have upheld the honor code.

**Honor Code**

You must type the full honor code into each comment block to indicate
that you have upheld the code. Authorized aid for this assignment is
your notes and any previous programs you have written. You are highly
encouraged to work with others in the class to help diagnose bugs and
work out programming logic. Any copying of someone else's code IS A
VIOLATION OF THE HONOR CODE, whether from a classmate, or the Internet.
*Be sure to indicate with whom you have worked in the comment block of
your submission.*

**Background**

Soundings and the parameters that can be calculated from them are
essential tools that meteorologists use on a daily basis. While it is
relatively easy to calculate some of these parameters by hand, it is
helpful to have predefined functions that can make easy work of doing
these calculations for any number of soundings. Additionally, it is
useful to automate the plotting of temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed
and direction on a skew-T diagram, so that a high-quality visualization
can be produced quickly and on-demand. This assignment will slowly build
a single program to calculate a number of variables and produce
high-quality output to an end user.

**Problems**

1.  Write a Python program that reads in a sounding data file from the
    Wyoming sounding archive and print the raw data to standard output.
    The program input should be the sounding location (three-letter
    identifier) and date/time in YYYYMMDDHH.

    Program Name: **soundings.py**

    Program Input: Sounding Location and Date/Time

    Program Output: Sounding Text File **(\<station
    ID\>\_YYYYMMDD\_HH.txt**) and Skew-T Image **(\<station
    ID\>\_YYYYMMDD\_HH.png**)

    Test Sounding Location: SGF

    Test Sounding Date/Time: 2004061212

2.  Calculate the following variables for each level in the sounding and
    create well formatted output similar in style to that of the Wyoming
    site including all appropriate variables:

-   Potential Temperature

-   Mixing Ratio

-   Relative Humidity

-   Wind Speed

-   Wind Direction

> Note: Utilize your resources well. These can all be calculated easily
> using the MetPy module.

3.  Calculate the following levels for a surface-based parcel path and
    add to the text output of problem 2:

-   Lifting Condensation Level

-   Level of Free Convection

-   Equilibrium Level

-   SBCAPE

-   SBCIN

    Note: Utilize your resources well. These can all be calculated easily using the MetPy module.

4.  Create a definition to calculate Lifted Index (LI) and add to the
    text output of problem 2. Be sure to include an appropriate
    docstring for the definition, defining the input, output, what is
    being calculated, and how is it being calculated. For reference, the
    following is the equation for calculating LI,

LI  = (T<sub>env</sub> â€“ T<sub>parcel</sub>)<sub>500</sub>

> where T<sub>env</sub> is the temperature of the environment (at 500 hPa) and T<sub>parcel</sub> is the temperature of the surface-based parcel (at 500 hPa).

5.  Create a definition to calculate the Total Totals (TT) index and add
    to the text output of problem 2. Be sure to include an appropriate
    docstring for the definition, defining the input, output, what is
    being calculated, and how is it being calculated. For reference, the
    following is the equation for calculating TT,

TT = T<sub>850</sub> + T<sub>d850</sub> - 2T<sub>500</sub>

> where T<sub>850</sub> is the temperature of the environment at 850 hPa, T<sub>d850</sub> is the dewpoint temperature of the environment at 850 hPa, and T<sub>500</sub> is the temperature of of the environment at 500 hPa. The TT index is derived from two parts: the vertical totals (VT) and the cross totals (CT),

VT = T<sub>850</sub> - T<sub>500</sub>

CT = T<sub>d850</sub> - T<sub>500</sub>

TT = VT + CT

6.  Plot the sounding on a skew-T using Python and include the
    surfaced-based parcel profile. Have an appropriate title on the
    skew-T with the station ID, date and time of the launch, and plot
    markers and text to identify the location of the LCL, LFC, and EL.

7.  Have the program assess the likelihood of severe weather happening
    as a result of a given sounding. Use the following critical values
    for skew-T parameters to have the program make the determination if
    severe weather is likely to occur or not. If at least two of the
    parameters outlined below are satisfied, then severe weather is more
    likely than not to occur if thunderstorms develop issue the
    following statement, "WARNING: SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE!",
    otherwise issue the following statement, "NOTE: Severe Thunderstorms
    Not Likely To Occur."

-   CAPE \>= 1500 J/kg

-   CIN \>= -125 J/kg

-   LI \<= -2C
