    "Python doesn't have a true array object. The closest thing to an array is a Python List (which are sometimes called array-like objects). Many of their properties are the same, but there are some notable differences depending on what you are trying to do. There are two ways to define a list, 1) using square brackets or 2) using the list function `list()`. For example the following two are equivalent,\n",

    "```\n",

    "Lists are mutable objects, meaning that you can redefine individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another array-like object in Python is the Tuple. Tuples are different than lists in that they are immutable objects, meaning they can't be changed once assigned. Tuples can also be defined in two different ways, 1) using parentheses or 2) using the tuple function `tuple()`. For example, the following two tuple assignments are equivalent,\n",
