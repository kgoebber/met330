    "# Scientific Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Python is great and has been around nearly 30 years. The power of python lies within the use of community built modules that lay on top of the core python programming language. These modules are abstract code designed to maximize the usefulness of OOP tools by providing advanced functions and methods to the objects in a program. What makes it powerful for scientific applications are the various libararies that have been written to work with scientific (and other) datasets. There is a great [graphic](https://fabienmaussion.info/acinn_python_workshop/figures/scipy_ecosystem.png) developed by Jake Vanderplas in 2015 and reproduced below to illustrate the structure of scientific Python libraries. At the base is the language itself, then the first tier libraries that are built off of the language, then packages that build upon both the language and the first tier libraries, and so on.\n",
