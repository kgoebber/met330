    "## Question #3\n",
    "(20 points) Write Python code to determine the average, maximum, and minimum SOI for each year. Also determine the months that the standardized Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) indicate El Nino conditions (for simplicity defined for this assignment as SOI < -1.25) or La Nina conditions (for simplicity defined for this assignment as SOI > 1.25) by reporting the month, year, and SOI value along with the designation of El Nino or La Nina. Additionally, determine the maximum and minimum value SOI over the entire period, reporting the month and year they occurred in. Print the results to the screen.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is a measure of the difference between sea level pressure in Tahiti and Darwin, Australian, which gives a proxy for shifts in the Walker Circulation and thus the El Nino – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are many other ways to define ENSO periods and a good resource for background information can be found at: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/why-are-there-so-many-enso-indexes-instead-just-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, an El Nino or La Nina event cannot be determined from any one month of an ENSO index, however, for simplicity here we define an El Nino event when the SOI value is below -1.25 for any particular month and a La Nina event when the SOI value is above 1.25 for any particular month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Break the problem down into smaller bite size pieces. For example, first write your program to be able to read in the input file and separate out the year column from the SOI data columns. Then work to find the global max and min values. Then work on finding individual months that can be classified as El Nino, etc.\n",
