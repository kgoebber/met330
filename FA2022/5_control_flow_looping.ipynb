    "# Control Flow - Looping\n",
    "There are many times when you'll want to do a repetative task (e.g., perform a calculation 100 or 1000 times) and using programming is a way to make that task more effecient. Iteration is a key component to any programming language due to the need to process data in a time effecient manner and Python offeres two different methods for looping (iterating) over a series of values: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",

    "In Python, the `for` loop is the most extensible method for iterating over an object. You are not relegated to just looping over a series of integer values, but can loop over a mixed list or other iterable object (e.g., dictionary keys). The construct of a `for` loop is:\n",

    "\n",
    "For each element in the iterable object (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`) the variable `var`, which is defined as the looping variable, assumes the values in sequence. So initially, `var` will have the value of `0`, it holds that while working through all of the code within the loop, then once you hit the end of the loop you go back to the beginning and `var` takes on the next value. This continues until all values in the iterable object are exhausted.\n",
