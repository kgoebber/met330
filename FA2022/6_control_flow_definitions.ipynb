    "\n",
    "Most of the time, scientists write code as a means to an end, so it ends up being useful for a small range of problems. A method to make your code more extensible and resuable is to modularize it into definitions (functions). When we use functions within our code (e.g., `range()`, `int()`, `float()`, etc.) we are called bits of code contained in definitions that have been packaged together. We could do the same thing to make it easier to reuse our code within other notebooks/projects.\n",
