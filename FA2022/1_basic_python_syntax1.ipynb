    "The required textbook for this calss is \"Python Programming and Visualization for Scientists, 2nd Ed.\" by Alex DeCaria. This is an excellent reference text for many of the concepts and skills related to Python that you will use over the course of the semester. At various points throughout the various Jupyter Notebooks that we'll use for lecture I point to a REF in the DeCaria text that aligns with the concept being taught. Please be sure to utilize this reference to fill gaps left by the limited time in class and lecture."
