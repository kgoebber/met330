    "## Reading in data to Python\n",
    "It is difficult to easily talk about reading data from a file into a Python program simply because there are so many ways to do so! Depending on what and how you are reading in data from a file there will be a number of different methods to read the file in. There are simple read functions that are contained in the Numpy module, and we are going to use one today. In the future we are going to use some read functionality from a packaged called Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org) that is in some ways built on top of the Numpy module and brings with it a whole lot of additional functionality. In this example we'll read in an ASCII (plain text) file that we can then use and manipulate to calculate or graph stuff to answer scientific questions! Specifically, the data that we are reading in is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) data from 1950 to 2013."
