    "# Reading and Plotting Shapefiles\n",
    "When we plot state borders, coastlines, rivers, etc. on a map, we are plotting data that is stored in a shapefile. A shapefile can contain any combination of the following geometry: Point, MultiPoint, Line, MultiLine, Polygon, and MultiPolygon. These geo-referenced data objects are widely used in GIS applications. A common source of shapefiles come from the decenial census and are commonly referred to as Tiger Files. Increasingly there are other data being distributed in this same format including projects from the National Weather Service.\n",
